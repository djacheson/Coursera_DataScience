##Designing Data Products
=====

### This course has a single assignment:
1. Write a [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
3. Share the application link by pasting it into the text box below
4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

### After the application has been made, the next step is to 'sell' the data product using [slidify](http://slidify.org/). This includes:
1. 5 slides to pitch the idea done in Slidify
2. The presentation pushed to github
